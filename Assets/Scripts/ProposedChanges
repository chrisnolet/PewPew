Heya, your player object should spawn the lazer with instantiate, and then set it's rigidbody velocity then and there.
Set the rigidbody property 'iskinematic' of the lazer to true. This will make it maintain constant velocity



instructions for deploying onto hololens:
.you have your build in the builds folder
.open the visual studio file
.three things to change: set "master", "x86", and "device" if you want to use hololens or emulator if you want to use that.
.press play! (i think, may have missed something)
.when asked for pin, on hololens navigate to settings, devs only, pairing, and the pin should be there
